This repository is to showcase my solutions (all in C) for Competitive Coding problems from various competitive coding websites. At the moment I am following the USACO training gateway, in the future
I will also add solutions to problems from IOI past papers and Leetcode problems. All the currently posted solutions are from the USACO training program, if you'd like to read the problem statement they can be found
on the USACO training gateway website.
