This repository is to showcase my solutions for Competitive Coding problems from various competitive coding websites such as the USACO training gateway, IOI and ICPC past papers, online contests and Codeforces solutions, and solutions to the CSES problem set. I've named the files according to the problem they solve, for IOI and ICPC I will include the past paper in the solution folder, otherwise the problem can be found in the problem set website that the problem originates from. For any Codeforces problems I will provide a link to the problem in the solution file.
